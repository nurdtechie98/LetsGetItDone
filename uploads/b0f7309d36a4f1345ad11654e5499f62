I want to get this course so that I can use it forward to do some independent projects along with the certification I get in this course which can form the basis for me to get hired by companies or get hired as free lancer as in current scenario where I am barely being able to pay for my college education with the help of scholarships and part time job money.If I get this course completed it would help me enhance my skill in a field that is in demand these days in that way I could earn my living . If entitled to the aid,I would make it a point help people back in return by actively participating in forums and public help platforms in whatever way possible. I hope you people will consider my situation and help me out for sure because education remains the only way one can help me permanently.Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs.  So Iâ€™m badly in need of this financial aid.I plan to complete all assignments on or before time and make sure that the trust shown by you guys is worth every penny.

I started to pursue engineering and nearby fields at a very young age by actively participating in various meetups  and tech events in the locality. But one thing that has always been a bottle neck has been the low family income. I recently found out about the financial grants and found out this could be one of the ways I could get the required certification to add credibility to my resume to get hired especially in such a field as deep learning which is on a rise around the world this time could be a great way to get started in the field. It could help me get a job and build a career in the field that I am passionate about along with making me stand on my own feet independently rather than being forced to go into some other industry just to meet me requirements. I plan to complete this course as a basic step and use the certificate as a proof of concept to various projects I am planning to get done in this field because by the current scenario I am pretty sure I won't be able to afford masters or specialization from any regular institute. I hope my request will be accepted and I will be granted the aid in bare minimum cost 

At this point of time the struggles I am going through I wont be able to do anything as paying the amount itself let alone the the low-interest but Once I start earning on my own i will make sure to pay it back as of now i will make sure to contribute to communities and platforms you have in whatever way possible
